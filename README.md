# matchmaker
Keyword search tool. Will check for technical keywords in the job listing and search those keywords in the resume.

1. Create new virtual environment and install requirements
2. Update path to your resume in .pdf format in matchmaker.resume.resume.py
3. To run user `python app.py`

This is only bootstrap. Need performance improvement and multiple other fixes.
